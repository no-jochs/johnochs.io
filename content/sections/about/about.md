I've always valued science highly; it's proven the best tool to answer the "why"s? our reality poses. So it's unsurprising that practical applications of science (technology) would fascinate me as well. I love technical problem solving. It an art that requires a unique type of creativity as it demands an eye for simplicity. It's also the talent I most enjoy exercising!

Before venturing into the tech sector, my opportunities to put my technical creativity to work were mostly academic, like constructing a trebuchet catapult able to fling cantaloupes across my high school's athletic fields as my senior project. Engineering seemed like the obvious discipline for me, and after high school I enrolled at the School of Engineering at Cornell University.

Cornell, I petitioned to create my own independent major in engineering. I wanted to develop the tools needed to work on the world's most pressing problems, so my primary focus included many courses in the Operations Research and Information Technology (ORIE) program. The secondary focus focused on concepts of sustainable development as I hoped to extend ORIE's powerful analytical tools (e.g. optimization, decision analysis, and simulation) to the social and environmental dimensions as well.

It wasn't until 2014 that I starting moving towards a profession in engineering. I was inspired by a friend who landed an incredible job at a well-known tech company after completing a 12-week coding bootcamp. Everything she described about software engineering reminded me of the times I had employed programmatic solutions for things like lab reports, or optimization and simulation problems. I started to teach myself the Ruby programming language and became obsessed! Two months later after being admitted to a highly selective 12-week coding bootcamp called App Academy, I found myself in San Francisco.

The curriculum was fast and challenging, and I graduated having mastered the Ruby and JavaScript programming languages, object oriented and functional programming paradigms, and frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js. I also computer science fundamental like algorithm analysis, data structures. I was amazed by how much I had learned in so little time, and I soon after I began my professional life as a software engineer.
Reflecting now on the eight years in production environments, there have been many hard won lessons that have shaped my approach to the technical aspects of developing software, and have come to appreciate how group dynamics, culture, and formal engineering process all contribute sustainable software development that can yield predictable development cycles, delivers features on time and on spec, and makes for happier stakeholders and engineers.

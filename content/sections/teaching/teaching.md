I can help you grow your knowledge and confidence with mathematics, the physical sciences, computer science, and software development! I graduated from the College of Engineering at Cornell University. My relevant studies ranged from physical sciences like physics and chemistry to operations research, information engineering, and all the mathematics that these disciplines depend on (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and statistics). I am available to tutor you in any of these topics, or to assist you in your technical project!

For the last seven years, I have worked professionally as a software engineer. I use technologies like Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and related frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Node.js, React.js, and others. If you are new to programming, I am excited to get you off on the right foot by learning computer science fundamentals and the coding best practices. Whether you're just starting a computer science curriculum, trying to build your own application, or starting to interview for jobs, I can help!

As a tutor, I pride myself on my patience and my ability to explain complicated concepts using analogies and real-world scenarios. I always try to understand the interests and lifestyle of my students so I can customize my educational approach with language and examples that draw on their personal experience. My lessons are designed to spark my student’s interest and curiosity, and the content is presented in an intuitive way that is easy for them to assimilate and remember. I work to assure that my students are comfortable with the fundamentals of the subject they’re learning; this assures a firm foundation on which to build knowledge of advanced topics. I am very excited to ignite the passion I have found in science, math, computer science, and technology in others! Please reach out to me so I can help you cultivate the knowledge and skill you need in an easy, fun, and accessible style motivated by positive reinforcement and successful outcomes!
